1)Application Purpose: The primary goal of the application is to enable villagers to easily communicate their issues, questions, or problems to their local Union council members. This allows for a streamlined way of addressing various concerns within the village.

2)User Interaction:

Villagers: The application will provide a platform for villagers to register and log in. Once logged in, they can submit their queries through the application.
Union Council Members: Council members will have a separate access level, allowing them to view the queries submitted by villagers, keep track of their progress, and suggest potential solutions.

3)User Workflow:

Villagers: Village residents will sign up on the application using their details. They will then submit their queries, which could be related to community issues, infrastructure problems, or any other concerns they may have.
Union Council Members: Council members will have a dashboard where they can see the list of queries submitted by villagers. They can prioritize these queries based on urgency or significance and propose solutions.

4)Features:

User Registration: Villagers and council members will need to create accounts to access the application.
Query Submission: Villagers can submit their queries online. This might include adding descriptions, images, or other relevant details to explain the problem.
Query Tracking: Both villagers and council members can track the status of queries, allowing them to see whether a query is pending, being reviewed, or has been resolved.
Solution Proposal: Council members can suggest solutions for the submitted queries. This might involve outlining steps to address the problem, estimated costs, and potential timelines.
Feedback Loop: Villagers can provide feedback on the proposed solutions, helping to refine and improve the solutions based on community input.

5)Advantages:

Efficiency: Digital platforms can expedite the process of addressing and resolving issues compared to traditional methods.
Transparency: The application promotes transparency by keeping villagers informed about the progress of their queries and the proposed solutions.
Community Engagement: It encourages active participation from villagers in improving their own community.
Data Analysis: Over time, the application can gather data on recurring issues, enabling the Union council to identify trends and prioritize specific areas for improvement.

6)Challenges:

Access and Connectivity: Ensuring that all villagers have access to the application, which might require addressing issues related to technology literacy, smartphone availability, and internet connectivity.
User Adoption: Encouraging villagers and council members to consistently use the application.
Data Security and Privacy: Implementing robust security measures to protect users' personal and sensitive information.
